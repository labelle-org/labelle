Labelle is not affiliated with DYMO. Please see the [disclaimer](#disclaimers) below.

For more information about experimental device support, see [#4](https://github.com/labelle-org/labelle/issues/4).

## Installation

It is recommended to install Labelle with
[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) so that it runs in an isolated virtual
environment:

```bash
pipx install labelle
```

In case pipx is not already installed, it can be installed on Ubuntu/Debian with

```bash
sudo apt-get install pipx
```

or on Arch with

```bash
sudo pacman -S python-pipx
```

By default, users don't have permission to access generic USB devices, so you will
need to add a rule. The first time you run `labelle`, it will give instructions
about how to do this:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```bash
$ labelle "Hello world"
...
You do not have sufficient access to the device. You probably want to add the a udev rule in /etc/udev/rules.d with the following command:

  echo 'ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0922", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1001", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/91-labelle-1001.rules
...
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

## Testing experimental features

To install a test branch, by GitHub user `ghuser` for the branch `branchname`, run

```bash
pipx install --force git+https://github.com/ghuser/labelle@branchname
```

To revert back to the release version, run

```bash
pipx install --force labelle
```

To install a particular release version, specify `labelle==x.y.z` in place of
`labelle` in the above command.

## Development and code style

To install for development, fork and clone this repository, and run (ideally
within a venv):

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run some checks
before committing.
After installing the `pre-commit` executable, please run

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Font management

Default fonts are managed via [labelle.ini](labelle.ini).
This should be placed in your config folder (normally `~/.config`).
An example file is provided here.

For my Arch-Linux System, fonts are located at e.g.

```bash
/usr/share/fonts/TTF/DejaVuSerif.ttf
```

It is also possible to Download a font from
<http://font.ubuntu.com/> and use it.

For font discovery, Labelle contains code excerpts from
[`matplotlib`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/).
See [here](vendoring/README.md) for more information and
[LICENSE](src/labelle/_vendor/matplotlib/LICENSE) for the license.

Labelle includes the Carlito font, licensed under the
[SIL Open Font License](src/labelle/resources/fonts/LICENSE).

## Modes

### Overview

For a comprehensive list of options, run

```bash
labelle --help
```

### Preview

To save tape, you can preview the label without printing it

```bash
labelle --output=console --text Hi
```

### Text

If your text includes whitespace or any other characters like `<` or `$` that are
interpreted by your shell, then the text must be quoted.

```bash
labelle --text 'Price: $3.50'
```

Multiple text arguments will stack on top of each other as separate lines

```bash
labelle --text "first line" --text "second line"
```

### Print Codes and Text

Just add a text after your qr or barcode text

```bash
labelle --qr "QR Content" --text "Cleartext printed"
```

### Picture printing

Any commonly-supported raster image may be printed.

```bash
labelle --picture labelle.png
```

## GUI

### Run Labelle GUI

```bash
labelle-gui
```
